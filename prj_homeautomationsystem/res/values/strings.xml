    <string name = "slidepanel_body">In order to toggle one of the five available appliances ON/OFF, you must speak the word into the microphone as soon as you press the \'Record Command\' button.\n\nThese commands are:\n1. Coffee | 2. Heating | 3. Lights | 4. Radio | 5. Television\n\nNote that you have only 1 second in which to issue the command, so it is important to speak loudly and fairly quickly.\n\nIf you find the speech recognition is not performing as well as you would like, you can try one of the other speech classifiers.\n\nIn order to switch between classifiers, press the app icon on the landing page to bring up the list of classifiers. Alternatively, lay a finger on the top-left edge of the screen while on the landing page and slide it to the right. The default classifier is the Artificial Neural Network.\n\nTo activate the Pebble companion, please make sure the Pebble is turned on with Bluetooth enabled - ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the phone as well, and that the Android Pebble app as well as the Pebble Watchface are installed on the phone and watch respectively. </string>
